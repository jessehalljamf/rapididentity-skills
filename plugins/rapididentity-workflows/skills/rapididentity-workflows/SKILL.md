# RapidIdentity Workflows — Authoring Skill

RapidIdentity portal workflows are JSON-defined automation sequences that run in response to
portal entitlement requests. They chain typed action nodes — DSS calls, approvals, conditions,
email sends — and pass data between steps using `%{variable}` substitution.

## Workflow JSON Structure

A workflow is a flat array of action objects. Each action has an `id`, `type`, `name`, and
routing fields that form the directed graph.

```json
{
  "name": "My Workflow",
  "description": "One-sentence description.",
  "actions": [
    { "type": "startAction", "id": "start", "name": "Start Action", "nextActionId": "<first-action-id>" },
    { "type": "endAction",   "id": "end",   "name": "End Action" },
    { "type": "failAction",  "id": "<uuid>","name": "Failed", "nextActionId": "end" },
    ...
  ]
}
```

**Required actions** — every workflow must include exactly one `startAction`, one `endAction`,
and at least one `failAction`. The `startAction.nextActionId` points to the first real step.

**Routing fields by action type:**

| Field | Used by |
|---|---|
| `nextActionId` | Most linear actions |
| `onTrueActionId` / `onFalseActionId` | `conditionAction` |
| `onApproveId` / `onDenyId` | `approvalAction` |

---

## Action Types

### `startAction`

```json
{ "type": "startAction", "id": "start", "name": "Start Action", "nextActionId": "<uuid>" }
```

### `endAction`

```json
{ "type": "endAction", "id": "end", "name": "End Action" }
```

### `failAction`

```json
{ "type": "failAction", "id": "<uuid>", "name": "Failed", "nextActionId": "end" }
```

### `advancedDssAction`

Calls a Connect action set and exposes its return value as `%{dss.*}` variables.
See § advancedDssAction for full details.

### `approvalAction`

Routes to `onApproveId` or `onDenyId` based on approver decision.
See § approvalAction for full details.

### `conditionAction`

Evaluates `operand1 OPERATION operand2` and routes true/false.
See § conditionAction for full details.

### `emailAction`

Sends an HTML email. See § emailAction for full details.

---

## Variable Reference Syntax

Workflow variables use `%{scope.field}` syntax and are resolved at runtime.

### Scopes

The complete set of accepted prefixes is `resource`, `recipient`, `requestor`, `requester`,
`addressee`, `approver`, `approval` (`WorkflowExpressions.java:51-58`), plus a fallthrough that
resolves anything else — notably `dss.*` and `form.*` — from the request context. Matching is
case-insensitive; `requestor` and `requester` are exact synonyms.

| Scope | Contents |
|---|---|
| `%{form.*}` | Form field values submitted by the requester |
| `%{request.*}` | Workflow request metadata (e.g. `%{request.comments}`) |
| `%{requester.*}` | Requester's RI account attributes (e.g. `%{requester.mail}`). On a **proxied** request this resolves to the proxy actor, not the stored requester |
| `%{recipient.*}` | Recipient's RI account attributes (e.g. `%{recipient.dn}`) — the person the entitlement is *for* |
| `%{resource.*}` | The entitlement being requested (e.g. `%{resource.name}`) |
| `%{addressee.*}` | The **current approval task's** addressee — not a request participant |
| `%{approver0.*}` | The user who acted on the first approval step |
| `%{approval0.*}` | Attributes from the first approval step (e.g. `%{approval0.comments}`) |
| `%{dss.*}` | Return fields from the most recent `advancedDssAction` call |

Nested paths walk LDAP: `%{recipient.manager.mail}` fetches `manager` off the recipient's DN, then
`mail` off that DN. `dn`, `id`, and `idautoid` are terminal (no LDAP lookup).

> **Requester vs recipient.** These are separate identities on every request — a self-request is
> just the case where they're equal. When a user requests *on behalf of* someone else, `recipient`
> is the other person. Two consequences that bite: entitlement ACLs are evaluated against the
> **recipient**, and `%{requester.manager}` is not `%{recipient.manager}`. See the KB article
> `rapididentity/requests/recipients-and-on-behalf-of.md`.

### Common variables

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `%{form.givenname}` | First name from the request form |
| `%{form.idautopersonenddate}` | Expiration date from the request form |
| `%{request.comments}` | Requester-entered comments on the request |
| `%{requester.mail}` | Email address of the person who submitted the request |
| `%{recipient.dn}` | Full DN of the selected recipient/sponsor |
| `%{approval0.comments}` | Comments entered by the approver when approving or denying |
| `%{dss.success}` | `true` or `false` returned from the Connect action set |
| `%{dss.message}` | Message string returned from the Connect action set |
| `%{dss.idautoPersonClaimCode}` | Claim code returned from WFM action set |
| `%{dss.idautoPersonUsernameMV}` | Username returned from WFM action set |
| `%{dss.mail}` | Email address returned from WFM action set |
| `%{dss.portalURL}` | Portal URL returned from WFM action set |

> **Scope availability** — `%{approval0.*}` is only populated after an `approvalAction` has
> been reached. Never reference it in emails that fire before the approval step.

---

## `advancedDssAction`

Calls a Connect action set synchronously and maps its `JSON.stringify(results)` return value
into `%{dss.*}` variables.

```json
{
  "type": "advancedDssAction",
  "id": "<uuid>",
  "name": "Create/Update Account",
  "actionName": "WFMValidateAccount",
  "nextActionId": "<uuid>",
  "valuePairs": [
    "givenname='%{form.givenname}'",
    "sn='%{form.sn}'",
    "mail='%{form.mail}'",
    "requestcomments='%{request.comments}'",
    "approvercomments='%{approval0.comments}'",
    "requesteremail='%{requester.mail}'",
    "manager='%{recipient.dn}'"
  ]
}
```

**`valuePairs` syntax** — each string is `paramName='value'` where the value is a literal or
a `%{}` variable reference. Single quotes around the value are required.

**Validate-only pattern** — to call the action set for validation without writing, add
`"validateOnly='true'"` to the `valuePairs`. The `advancedDssAction` is then wired to a
`conditionAction` that checks `%{dss.success}`:

```json
{ "type": "conditionAction", "operand1": "%{dss.success}", "operation": "MATCHES_ANY_REGEX", "operand2": "true",
  "onTrueActionId": "<approval-step>", "onFalseActionId": "<notify-invalid-email>" }
```

**Connect action set requirements** — the backing action set must:
- Return `JSON.stringify(results)` from every exit path
- Set `results.success = true` on success, `false` on any failure
- Set `results.message` on every path
- Initialize `logColors` in `defineDefaultVariables` using `Object.assign` so all color keys are always present regardless of whether `Global.connectLogColorSchema` is configured:

```xml
<action name="setVariable">
  <arg name="name" value="logColors"/>
  <arg name="value" value="Object.assign({changedData:&quot;chocolate&quot;,complete:&quot;teal&quot;,counts:&quot;black&quot;,data:&quot;blue&quot;,debug:&quot;purple&quot;,error:&quot;red&quot;,fail:&quot;darkred&quot;,info:&quot;royalBlue&quot;,logOnly:&quot;slateGray&quot;,processing:&quot;steelBlue&quot;,query:&quot;darkcyan&quot;,skipped:&quot;mediumpurple&quot;,sourceData:&quot;dimGray&quot;,success:&quot;green&quot;,targetData:&quot;darkslategray&quot;,test:&quot;darkorange&quot;,warn:&quot;goldenrod&quot;,whitespace:&quot;white&quot;},Global.connectLogColorSchema||{})"/>
</action>
```

Defaults are the base; `Global.connectLogColorSchema` overrides individual keys when present. Reference colors as `logColors.keyName` on every `log` action's `color` arg. See the connect-action-sets skill for the full key reference table.

---

## `approvalAction`

Pauses the workflow and creates an approval task for the specified group or user.

```json
{
  "type": "approvalAction",
  "id": "<uuid>",
  "name": "Approval",
  "description": "Approval description shown to the approver.",
  "approver": {
    "type": "groupApprover",
    "group": {
      "id": "<group-idautoID>",
      "dn": "idautoID=<group-idautoID>,ou=Groups,dc=meta",
      "name": "Portal Sponsor"
    }
  },
  "expirationDays": -1,
  "escalationDays": -1,
  "onApproveId": "<next-action-on-approve>",
  "onDenyId": "<email-action-on-deny>"
}
```

- `expirationDays: -1` means no expiration
- `escalationDays: -1` means no escalation
- `onApproveId` and `onDenyId` route to different action nodes based on the decision
- After the approval step resolves, `%{approval0.comments}` contains the approver's comments

### Approver types — only three exist

`Approver.groovy:40-44` registers exactly three Jackson subtypes:

| `approver.type` | Shape |
|---|---|
| `userApprover` | `"user": { "id", "dn", "name" }` |
| `groupApprover` | `"group": { "id", "dn", "name" }` |
| `expressionApprover` | `"expression": "%{...}"` |

> **There is no `managerApprover` or `recipientApprover`.** Both are commonly assumed (and were
> wrongly documented in the KB until 2026-08-01) but neither exists in the codebase — posting either
> fails Jackson subtype resolution. Route dynamically with `expressionApprover` instead.

```json
"approver": { "type": "expressionApprover", "expression": "%{recipient.manager}" }
```

| Intent | Expression |
|---|---|
| Recipient's manager (usual intent for on-behalf-of flows) | `%{recipient.manager}` |
| Requester's manager | `%{requester.manager}` |
| The recipient themself | `%{recipient}` |

Pick deliberately — on an on-behalf-of request `%{requester.manager}` routes to the *requesting*
manager's own manager, which is rarely what's wanted.

---

## `conditionAction`

```json
{
  "type": "conditionAction",
  "id": "<uuid>",
  "name": "If Successful",
  "operand1": "%{dss.success}",
  "operation": "MATCHES_ANY_REGEX",
  "operand2": "true",
  "onTrueActionId": "<uuid>",
  "onFalseActionId": "<uuid>"
}
```

Standard operations: `MATCHES_ANY_REGEX`, `EQUALS`, `NOT_EQUALS`, `CONTAINS`.

**`dss.success` check** — always use `MATCHES_ANY_REGEX` with `operand2: "true"` when branching
on a DSS result. String equality checks on boolean-like values are unreliable.

---

## `emailAction`

```json
{
  "type": "emailAction",
  "id": "<uuid>",
  "name": "Send Welcome Email",
  "from": "noreply@rapididentity.com",
  "toList": ["%{form.idautopersonhomeemail}"],
  "subject": "Welcome to RapidIdentity",
  "message": "<html>...</html>",
  "nextActionId": "<uuid>"
}
```

- `toList` is an array of addresses; supports `%{}` variable references
- `message` is a full HTML string — inline all CSS, no external stylesheets
- Workflow variables are substituted into the HTML at send time

### Comments section HTML pattern

Insert this block immediately before `<div class="footer">` to display requester and approver
comments in a styled section matching the standard detail card layout:

```html
<div class="section">
  <div class="section-title">Comments</div>
  <div class="details-card">
    <div class="detail-row">
      <div class="detail-label">Requester Comments</div>
      <div class="detail-value">%{request.comments}</div>
    </div>
    <div class="detail-row">
      <div class="detail-label">Approver Comments</div>
      <div class="detail-value">%{approval0.comments}</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

> **Important:** Only include the Approver Comments row in emails that fire **after** the
> approval step. Emails triggered before approval (e.g. "Request Invalid") should include
> only the Requester Comments row — `%{approval0.comments}` will be empty at that point.

---

## Workflow Flow Patterns

### Validate → Approve → Create

The standard WFM workflow pattern:

```
Start
  → advancedDssAction (validateOnly=true)
  → conditionAction (%{dss.success} == true)
      true  → approvalAction
                approve → advancedDssAction (create)
                            → conditionAction (%{dss.success} == true)
                                true  → emailAction (success) → emailAction (welcome) → End
                                false → emailAction (failure) → failAction → End
                deny  → emailAction (denied) → failAction → End
      false → emailAction (invalid) → failAction → End
```

This pattern uses the same Connect action set for both the validate and create steps,
controlled by the `validateOnly` valuePair.

---

## Entitlement Creation

Entitlements (portal resources) are the portal-facing objects that make a workflow requestable.
Creating one requires three sequential API calls. The Grant Workflow **must be Active** before
the entitlement can be created — a 400 error with "Grant Workflow must be active" means the
workflow status has not been set to Active yet.

### Step 1 — Create Data Classification

```
POST /api/rest/admin/workflow/dataClassifications
{ "name": "Sponsorship", "description": "Sponsorship Workflows", "level": 0, "color": "0x000000" }
```

Capture the returned `id` as `classificationId`.

### Step 2 — Create Category

```
POST /api/rest/admin/workflow/categories
{ "name": "Create Sponsored Accounts", "description": "Create Sponsored Accounts", "status": "ACTIVE" }
```

Capture the returned `id` as `categoryId`.

### Step 3 — Create the Resource (Entitlement)

```
POST /api/rest/admin/workflow/resources
{
  "name": "Request Sponsored Account",
  "status": "ACTIVE",
  "binding": "MULTI_UNBOUND",
  "classificationId": "<classificationId>",
  "categoryIds": ["<categoryId>"],
  "grantWorkflowId": "<workflowId>",
  "acl": { "groupAclsEnabled": true, "groupAcls": [{ "id": "<groupId>", "name": "<groupName>" }] }
}
```

**Binding values** — exactly four, from `ResourceType.java:13-18`. **Fixed after creation.**

| Value | Meaning | Revocable? |
|---|---|---|
| `SINGLE` | One active grant per user. A duplicate request is **rejected**, not replaced (`WorkflowEngineDAO.groovy:528-531` routes to `shouldGrantSingleResource`; `StartWorkflowRequestValidator.groovy:204-218` throws `error.wfm_request.duplicate_request`). | Yes |
| `MULTI_BOUND` | Multiple concurrent grants; each is tracked as its own association and can be revoked individually (`WorkflowEngineDAO.groovy:684-690` gives it a per-grant `REVOKED` end state). | Yes, per grant |
| `MULTI_UNBOUND` | Multiple concurrent grants, but **no grant can ever be revoked** — any `REVOKE` throws `error.wfm_request.may_not_revoke` (`StartWorkflowRequestValidator.groovy:219-224`). Its end states omit `REVOKED` entirely (`WorkflowEngineDAO.groovy:670-676`). | **No** |
| `ROLE` | Role-style entitlement. Deduplicates like `SINGLE` — same duplicate-request rejection (`StartWorkflowRequestValidator.groovy:205`). Has its own accessor `Resource.isRole()`. | Yes |

> There is **no `SINGLE_BOUND`** and **no `COMPOSITE`** value — earlier versions of this skill listed
> `SINGLE_BOUND`, which does not exist in the enum. Live tenant captures show `"binding":"ROLE"` and
> `"SINGLE"` in practice. The wire field is `binding` (`Resource.groovy:82-85`,
> `allowableValues = 'SINGLE,MULTI_BOUND,MULTI_UNBOUND,ROLE'`).

> **ACLs are evaluated against the recipient.** The `acl` block above (and any category ACL) is
> checked against the person the entitlement is *for*, not the person submitting the request
> (`StartWorkflowRequestValidator.groovy:317-327` → `ResourceVisibilityEvaluator`). Scope group and
> filter ACLs to the population that should **receive** the entitlement. A manager requesting for a
> report gets `400 Entitlement '...' is not visible to '<report name>'` when the report falls
> outside the ACL, even though the manager is inside it.

### Step 4 (optional) — Expiration, Extend / Reset, Re-Certification

Expiration is polymorphic on a `type` discriminator (`ResourceExpiration.groovy:31-44`):

```jsonc
"expiration": { "type": "timePeriod",  "timePeriod": { "days": 90 } }
"expiration": { "type": "annualDate",  "annualDate": "--08-31", "reCertificationPeriodDays": 14 }
```

Related resource fields: `canRequestExtend`, `canRequestReset`, `extendWorkflowId`, `extendFormId`,
`resetWorkflowId`, `resetFormId`, `disableCertification` (negative sense — certification is **on**
by default).

**Extend/reset only work on `timePeriod`.** `ResourceValidator.groovy:209-214` force-sets both
`canRequestExtend` and `canRequestReset` to `false` on any non-`timePeriod` expiration.
Re-certification works on both.

**Extend and reset compute from different baselines** (`EndActionExecutor.groovy:272-277`):
extend adds to the *current expiration*, reset adds to *now*. A grant expiring Sept 1, extended
today (Aug 1) by 3 months → **Dec 1**; reset instead → **Nov 1**. Reset can therefore *shorten*
access — it means "restart the clock," not "restore the original duration."

Full detail, both extend endpoints, the re-certification (`reAttest`) endpoints, and the error
reference: KB `rapididentity/requests/extend-reset-recertification.md`.

---

## Submitting a Request (including on behalf of another user)

```
POST /api/rest/workflow/tasks/startTask
{ "requestItems": [ {
    "type": "GRANT",
    "recipientId": "<recipient idautoID>",
    "resourceId": "<entitlementId>",
    "comments": "Requested on behalf of new hire",
    "requestForm": { "requestFormItems": [ { "name": "startDate", "value": "2026-08-15" } ] }
} ] }
```

- Note the base path is `/api/rest/workflow/...` — **not** the `/api/rest/admin/workflow/...` used
  by the definition/entitlement admin endpoints above.
- `recipientId` is the **idautoID** (not a DN, not a UUID). Set it to another user for on-behalf-of;
  the requester comes from the auth context and is never in the body.
- `requestItems` is a list — one call can batch multiple recipients/resources.
- `type` is `GRANT` or `REVOKE`; `REVOKE` also requires `previousRequestId`.

**Who may request for whom** (`StartWorkflowRequestValidator.groovy:249-279`): a non-privileged
requester may only target **themself or a direct report** (LDAP `manager` attribute).
`ADMIN`, `TENANT_ADMIN`, `WFM_ADMIN`, and `WFM_HELPDESK` may request for anyone. There is nothing in
between — arbitrary delegation requires one of those roles or a service-identity front-end.

**Finding valid recipients:** use `GET /api/rest/workflow/directReports/searchTask?criteria=` and
`GET /api/rest/workflow/directReports/users/{id}/associations` (which returns each resource with a
`notRequestable` flag). Do **not** use `/users/searchTask` — it is an org-wide people search that is
not filtered to users the caller may request for, so selections from it get rejected at submit time.

There is no "what can I request for user X" endpoint; the requestables search endpoints take no
recipient parameter. Full detail: KB `rapididentity/requests/recipients-and-on-behalf-of.md`.

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Fix |
|---|---|
| `%{approval0.comments}` empty in email | Email fires before the approval step. Remove the approver row from pre-approval emails. |
| `%{dss.success}` condition never matches | Use `MATCHES_ANY_REGEX` not `EQUALS` for boolean-like DSS return values. |
| valuePairs not passing data | Each pair must be `paramName='value'` — single quotes around the value are required. |
| DSS action returns no data | The Connect action set must return `JSON.stringify(results)` — a raw object or `null` return will not populate `%{dss.*}`. |
| Entitlement 400: Grant Workflow must be active | Set the workflow Status to **Active** before creating the entitlement resource. |
| Welcome email going to wrong address | Check `toList` — the welcome email should target `%{form.idautopersonhomeemail}`, not `%{requester.mail}`. |
| validateOnly step also sets approvercomments | Safe to include `approvercomments='%{approval0.comments}'` on the validate step — it will be empty and the action set's optional handling will skip it. |
| `400 Entitlement '...' is not visible to '...'` | The **recipient** doesn't match the entitlement's group/filter ACL. ACLs evaluate against the recipient, not the requester — re-scope the ACL to who should *receive* it. |
| `403 You are not allowed to request entitlements for '...'` | The requester is neither the recipient nor their manager, and lacks `WFM_ADMIN`/`WFM_HELPDESK`/`ADMIN`/`TENANT_ADMIN`. |
| `approver.type: "managerApprover"` rejected | That type doesn't exist. Use `{ "type": "expressionApprover", "expression": "%{recipient.manager}" }`. |
| Manager approval routed to the wrong person | On an on-behalf-of request, `%{requester.manager}` is the requesting manager's *own* manager. Use `%{recipient.manager}`. |
| Connect action set can't see the recipient | Nothing is auto-injected — pass it explicitly, e.g. `recipientdn='%{recipient.dn}'`. |
| `binding: "SINGLE_BOUND"` rejected | That value doesn't exist. The four real values are `SINGLE`, `MULTI_BOUND`, `MULTI_UNBOUND`, `ROLE`. |
| Extend/Reset checkboxes unavailable on an entitlement | The expiration is `annualDate`. The validator force-sets `canRequestExtend`/`canRequestReset` to `false` on anything that isn't `timePeriod` — set a `timePeriod` expiration instead. |
| Entitlement save throws on `extendFormId` | An extend form requires a paired `extendWorkflowId` (`ResourceValidator.groovy:574-579`), and the form must belong to that workflow definition. Same for reset. |
| Extend applied with no approval | `extendWorkflowId` is missing, typo'd, or not `ACTIVE` — a bare Start→End stub runs instead and the date change commits **with no error**. Verify the ID resolves to an active definition. |
| Extension shorter than requested | Silently clamped to the resource's configured max period at request time; the warning appears only in the response `message` field while `result` still returns a request ID. HTTP status stays 200. |
| "Reset" shortened someone's access | Expected. Reset re-bases the expiration on **now**, so on a far-future expiration it moves the date *earlier*. Use extend to bank unused time. |
